= Bz Kanban Board

== About

Visualize Bugzilla milestones as cards and columns with a Kanban inspired board.

The goal is to compliment an existing Bugzilla workflow, so board columns represent actual bug statuses.
Cards can be dragged from one column to another to change the bug status.

It is implemented as a single-page application that uses Ajax calls to a http://bugzilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html[Bugzilla 5.0+ server REST API].
